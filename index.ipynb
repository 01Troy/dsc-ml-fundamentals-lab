The main emphasis is on modeling theory (not EDA or preprocessing), so we will skip over some of the data visualization and data preparation steps that you would take in an actual modeling process."

    "Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a treatable condition, but measuring blood pressure requires specialized equipment that most people do not have at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question, then, is ***can we predict blood pressure using just a scale and a tape measure***? These measuring tools, which individuals are more likely to have at home, might be able to flag individuals with an increased risk of hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Researchers in Brazil](https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/637635) collected data from several hundred college students in order to answer this question. We will be specifically using the data they collected from female students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurements we have are:\n",

    "* Age (age in years)\n",
    "* BMI (body mass index, a ratio of weight to height)\n",

    "\n",
    "Before looking at the text below, try to remember: why is a train-test split the *first* step in a machine learning process?\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning (predictive) workflow fundamentally emphasizes creating *a model that will perform well on unseen data*. We will hold out a subset of our original data as the \"test\" set that will stand in for truly unseen data that the model will encounter in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make this separation as the first step for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most importantly, we are avoiding *leakage* of information from the test set into the training set. Leakage can lead to inflated metrics, since the model has information about the \"unseen\" data that it won't have about real unseen data. This is why we always want to fit our transformers and models on the training data only, not the full dataset.\n",
    "2. Also, we want to make sure the code we have written will actually work on unseen data. If we are able to transform our test data and evaluate it with our final model, that's a good sign that the same process will work for future data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading the Data\n",
